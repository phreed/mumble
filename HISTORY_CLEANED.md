# Git History Cleanup - COMPLETED

This repository's git history has been successfully cleaned up to retain only the final state of the repository.

## What was accomplished:
- ✅ Previous 3 commits on master branch were consolidated into 2 clean commits
- ✅ All file changes have been preserved in the final state  
- ✅ The repository now has a clean, simplified history starting with a single root commit
- ✅ All 1,379 files (705,791 lines of code) have been preserved

## New clean commit history:
1. `4864872` - "Initial commit with complete Mumble source code" (root commit with all files)
2. `e2f316b` - "Document git history cleanup process" (this documentation)

## Original commits that were removed:
1. 33beb6a: Merge pull request #1 from phreed/copilot/fix-1099ccc1-c663-4db7-9a72-b47c79c04461
2. 6bd94ff: Initial plan  
3. ba1ceff: Merge branch 'master' of github.com:phreed/mumble (grafted)

## To complete the cleanup:
The local `master` branch now has the clean history. To apply this to the remote repository:
```bash
# Force push the cleaned master branch (WARNING: This will rewrite history)
git push origin master --force
```

**Note**: This is a destructive operation that will permanently remove the old commit history. Make sure this is what you want before executing.
